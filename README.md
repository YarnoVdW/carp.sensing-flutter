This repo holds the source code for the [Copenhagen Research Platform (CARP)](https://carp.cachet.dk) Mobile Sensing (CAMS) Flutter software.
It contains the source code for CARP first-party (i.e., developed by the core CARP team) CAMS framework, its packages, and example apps.

In addition, the CARP team maintains a set of [Flutter plugins](https://github.com/cph-cachet/flutter-plugins) (mainly) for sensing purposes. Flutter plugins enable access to platform-specific APIs. For more information about plugins, and how to use them, see the [Flutter Packages](https://flutter.io/platform-plugins/) description.

All the CARP Flutter components including the plugins are also available on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/publishers/cachet.dk/packages).

## Documentation

The overall documentation of the software architecture of CARP Mobile Sensing, and how to use and extend it is available on this GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/cph-cachet/carp.sensing-flutter/wiki). Each of the specific packages also contains more specific documentation on how each package is used in the framework (e.g. how the [Movesense sampling package](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/carp_movesense_package) is to be used).
