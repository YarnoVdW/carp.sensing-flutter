/// This library contains the software architecture for the CARP Mobile Sensing (CAMS)
/// framework implemented in Flutter. Supports cross-platform (iOS and Android) sensing.
///
/// The CAMS software architecture is a domain-drive design (DDD) model using an
/// onion-based layout with the following onion layers:
///
///  * [domain] - contains the core domain model for CAMS which extends the domain
///             model of the [carp_core](https://pub.dev/packages/carp_core) domain model.
///  * [runtime] - contains the business logic for executing a sensing study (normally
///              called 'application services' in DDD).
///  * [services] - contains all services definitions used for sensing.
///  * [infrastructure] - contains specific implementation of the services used.
///
/// Domain-driven design (DDD) is a software design approach that focuses on modeling
/// the software to match the domain, or the subject area, that the software is
/// intended for. DDD helps developers create software that is aligned with the
/// business needs and terminology of the domain experts, users, and stakeholders.
