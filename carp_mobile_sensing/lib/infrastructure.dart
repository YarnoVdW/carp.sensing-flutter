/// The infrastructure library provide on-phone implementations of CAMS services

/// This library also holds the two built-in sampling packages:

///  * [device] - a sampling package for collecting information from the device hardware.
///  * [sensors] - a sampling package for collecting data from the basic phone sensors:

/// In terms of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), "the infrastructure layer is responsible

/// The infrastructure layer should be generic and adaptable, implementing the
/// interfaces or abstractions that are defined by the domain layer."
