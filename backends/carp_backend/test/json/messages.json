Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.\n\nA healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include:\n\n - Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro or cassava).\n - Legumes (lentils and beans).\n - Fruit and vegetables.\n - Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).\n\nHere is some useful information, based on WHO recommendations, to follow a healthy diet, and the benefits of doing so.",
